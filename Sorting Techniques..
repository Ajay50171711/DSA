BUBBLE SORT...

What is Bubble Sort?
Bubble Sort is one of the simplest sorting algorithms. It sorts a list by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.

How does Bubble Sort work?

 ->  Start at the beginning of the list.
 ->  Compare the current element with the next element.
 ->  If the current element is greater than the next, swap them.
 ->  Move to the next pair and repeat until the end of the list.
 ->  After each pass, the largest unsorted element "bubbles up" to its correct position at the end.
 ->  Repeat the process for the remaining unsorted part of the list until fully sorted.

Lets understand it with the help of an example:

Sort the array: [5, 3, 8, 4, 2]

Pass 1:
Compare 5 and 3 → swap → [3, 5, 8, 4, 2]
Compare 5 and 8 → no swap → [3, 5, 8, 4, 2]
Compare 8 and 4 → swap → [3, 5, 4, 8, 2]
Compare 8 and 2 → swap → [3, 5, 4, 2, 8]

Largest number 8 is now at the end.

Pass 2:
Compare 3 and 5 → no swap → [3, 4, 5, 2, 8]
Compare 5 and 4 → swap → [3, 4, 5, 2, 8]
Compare 5 and 2 → swap → [3, 4, 2, 5, 8]

Pass 3:
Compare 3 and 4 → no swap
Compare 4 and 2 → swap → [3, 2, 4, 5, 8]

Pass 4:
Compare 3 and 2 → swap → [2, 3, 4, 5, 8]

Now the array is sorted!

Complexity:

Time Complexity:       Worst and average case: O(n²)
                       Best case (already sorted): O(n)

Best case (already sorted): O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1) (in-place sorting)

Selection Sort....

What is Selection Sort?

Selection Sort is a sorting algorithm that divides the list into two parts: 
the sorted part at the front and the unsorted part at the back. 
It repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the 
unsorted part and swaps it with the first element in the unsorted part,
growing the sorted part by one element each time.

How does Selection Sort work?

-> Start with the entire list as unsorted.
-> Find the minimum element in the unsorted part.
-> Swap this minimum element with the first element of the unsorted part.
-> Now, the sorted part increases by one element (at the front).
-> Repeat the process for the rest of the unsorted list.

Lets understand it with the help of an example:

Sort the array: [64, 25, 12, 22, 11]

Pass 1:
Find the minimum element in [64, 25, 12, 22, 11] → 11
Swap 11 with 64 → [11, 25, 12, 22, 64]

Pass 2:
Find the minimum element in [25, 12, 22, 64] → 12
Swap 12 with 25 → [11, 12, 25, 22, 64]

Pass 3:
Find the minimum element in [25, 22, 64] → 22  
Swap 22 with 25 → [11, 12, 22, 25, 64]

Pass 4:
Find the minimum element in [25, 64] → 25
Swap 25 with 25 (no change)
The list is now sorted: [11, 12, 22, 25, 64]

Complexity:
Time Complexity:
Worst, average, and best case: O(n²)
(because it always scans the remaining unsorted part)

Space Complexity: O(1) (in-place sorting)

============================================================================

Insertion Sort.......

What is Insertion Sort?

Insertion Sort is a sorting algorithm that builds the 
sorted array one element at a time by repeatedly taking 
the next element and inserting it into its correct position 
among the previously sorted elements.

How does Insertion Sort work?

 -> Start with the second element (consider the first element sorted).
 -> Compare the current element with the elements before it.
 -> Shift all larger elements one position to the right.
 -> Insert the current element into its correct position.
 -> Repeat for all elements.

Lets understand it with the help of an example:

Sort the array: [5, 3, 8, 4, 2]

Pass 1 (consider 3):
Compare 3 with 5 → 5 is larger, shift 5 right → [5, 5, 8, 4, 2]
Insert 3 in place of 5 → [3, 5, 8, 4, 2]

Pass 2 (consider 8):
8 is greater than 5 → no shifting needed → [3, 5, 8, 4, 2]

Pass 3 (consider 4):
Compare 4 with 8 → shift 8 right → [3, 5, 8, 8, 2]
Compare 4 with 5 → shift 5 right → [3, 5, 5, 8, 2]
Insert 4 → [3, 4, 5, 8, 2]

Pass 4 (consider 2):
Compare 2 with 8 → shift 8 right → [3, 4, 5, 8, 8]
Compare 2 with 5 → shift 5 right → [3, 4, 5, 5, 8]
Compare 2 with 4 → shift 4 right → [3, 4, 4, 5, 8]
Compare 2 with 3 → shift 3 right → [3, 3, 4, 5, 8]
Insert 2 → [2, 3, 4, 5, 8]

Now the array is sorted!

Complexity:

Time Complexity:
Worst and average case: O(n²)
Best case (already sorted): O(n)

Space Complexity: O(1) (in-place sorting)
Stable sort: Yes (it preserves the order of equal elements)

QUICK SORT

What is Quick sort ?

Quick Sort is a method to sort a list (like numbers) from 
smallest to largest using a smart "divide and conquer" strategy.

How does Quick Sort work?

 -> Picking a special number called a pivot.
 -> Splitting the list into two groups.
 -> Numbers less than the pivot.
 -> Numbers greater than the pivot.
 -> Sorting those groups again and again the same way.
 -> Putting all the pieces back together.

Lets understand it with the help of an example:

Let’s say we want to sort this list:     [7, 2, 1, 6, 8, 5, 3, 4]

Step 1: Pick a Pivot
Let’s choose the last number in the list as the pivot.
 Pivot = 4

Step 2: Divide the List
 Put numbers into two groups:
 Less than 4 → [2, 1, 3]
 Greater than 4 → [7, 6, 8, 5]
 Pivot stays in the middle → 4
[2, 1, 3] + [4] + [7, 6, 8, 5]

Step 3: Repeat Quick Sort on Smaller Lists
Now, we repeat the same process for [2, 1, 3] and [7, 6, 8, 5].

Sort [2, 1, 3]
Pivot = 3
Less than 3 = [2, 1]
Greater than 3 = [] (empty)
[2, 1] + [3]

Now sort [2, 1]:
Pivot = 1
Less than 1 = []
Greater than 1 = [2]
Sorted: [] + [1] + [2] = [1, 2]

Now sort [2, 1]:
Pivot = 1
Less than 1 = []
Greater than 1 = [2]
Sorted: [] + [1] + [2] = [1, 2]
[1, 2] + [3] = [1, 2, 3]

Sort [7, 6, 8, 5]

Pivot = 5
Less than 5 = []
Greater than 5 = [7, 6, 8]
Sort [7, 6, 8]:

Pivot = 8
Less than 8 = [7, 6]
Greater than 8 = []
Sort [7, 6]:

Pivot = 6
Less than 6 = []
Greater than 6 = [7]
Sorted: [] + [6] + [7] = [6, 7]

[6, 7] + [8] = [6, 7, 8]`
Then: [5] + [6, 7, 8] = [5, 6, 7, 8]

tep 4: Combine Everything

Now put all sorted parts together:
[1, 2, 3] + [4] + [5, 6, 7, 8] = ✅ [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]

Final Sorted List:
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
