1. 📖 Introduction
A Linked List is a linear data structure where each element (node) points to the next. It does not store data in contiguous memory like arrays.

| Feature            | Array                | Linked List            |
| ------------------ | -------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Size               | Fixed                | Dynamic                |
| Memory Allocation  | At once (contiguous) | One-by-one (scattered) |
| Insertion/Deletion | Hard in middle       | Easy                   |
| Random Access      | Yes (fast)           | No (go step by step)   |


3. 🔁 Types of Linked Lists
----------------------------
Singly Linked List

Doubly Linked List

Circular Linked List 

Doubly Circular Linked List
--------------------------------------
In C, there is no built-in data type that can store both data and a memory address (pointer) together in one unit.

But in a linked list, each element (called a node) must store:

1)Data (like an integer, float, etc.)

2)Address of the next node (i.e., a pointer)

So, to combine these two things (data + pointer), we use a user-defined data type using struct.

4. 🧱 Node Structure (in C)
struct Node {
    int data;
    struct Node *next;
};
